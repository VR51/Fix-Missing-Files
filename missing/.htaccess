## Fix missing image and file requests
## Version 0.0.2
## Change each of the {REQUEST_URI} lines in each directive set to specify the missing file 404 requests to check against.
## The replacement file(s) to serve should go into a server directory called "missing" located under public_html/
## Image formats go into the Image Set. No file required to be added to the 'missing' directory
## Other formats go into the File Set. Place an empty text file with correct extension into the 'missing' directory
## See https://journalxtra.com/web-development/fix-missing-file-404-requests/
